# Object-tracking-with-color

Here I am detecting objects using their color. The color format of BGR is converted into HSV. I have created 6 trackbars to adjust the range of color and detect the required object.

In the image I have tracked the movement of ball using the ball color. The main problem is that if the lighting is not proper the result will have more noise.
